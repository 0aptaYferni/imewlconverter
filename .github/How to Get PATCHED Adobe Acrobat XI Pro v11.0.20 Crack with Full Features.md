- In 712, Muhammad bin Qasim, an Arab general, conquered Sindh and established the first Muslim rule in the region. He was followed by other Muslim invaders, such as Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad of Ghor, Qutb-ud-din Aibak and others, who expanded their domains to Punjab, Delhi and beyond.
- In 1206, Qutb-ud-din Aibak founded the Delhi Sultanate, which lasted for over three centuries and saw the rise and fall of five dynasties: the Mamluks, the Khaljis, the Tughlaqs, the Sayyids and the Lodis. The Delhi Sultanate faced challenges from the Mongols, the Turks, the Rajputs and the Vijayanagara Empire.
- In 1398, Timur, a Turkic-Mongol ruler, invaded India and sacked Delhi, causing widespread devastation and weakening the Delhi Sultanate. He also paved the way for the emergence of the Mughal Empire, which was founded by his descendant Babur in 1526.
- The Mughal Empire reached its zenith under Akbar (1556-1605), who consolidated his power by expanding his territory, promoting religious tolerance, patronizing art and culture, and introducing administrative reforms. His successors Jahangir (1605-1627), Shah Jahan (1628-1658) and Aurangzeb (1658-1707) continued to rule over most of India, but also faced rebellions from the Sikhs, the Marathas, the Rajputs and others.
- The decline of the Mughal Empire began after Aurangzeb's death in 1707, as it was plagued by internal strife, succession wars, regional revolts and foreign invasions. The Marathas emerged as a powerful force under Shivaji (1630-1680) and his successors, who challenged the Mughal authority and established their own empire in western and central India.
- The British East India Company gradually gained control over trade and politics in India through a series of wars, treaties and alliances with various Indian rulers. The Company also faced competition from other European powers, such as the French, the Dutch and the Portuguese.
- In 1857, a large-scale uprising broke out among the Indian soldiers of the Company's army against their British officers. The revolt was sparked by various grievances, such as religious interference, economic exploitation and political oppression. The revolt spread to several regions of northern and central India and involved various sections of Indian society. It was suppressed by the British after a year of fierce fighting.
- The revolt of 1857 marked the end of the Mughal Empire and the Company's rule in India. It also led to the transfer of power from the Company to the British Crown in 1858. The British government introduced various changes in its administration, policies and attitude towards India after 1857.
